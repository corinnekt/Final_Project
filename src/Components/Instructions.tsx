//criteria:
// ✅ Use React Router
// ✅ have at least 3 pages using React Bootstrap
// ✅ Contain at least 10 custom components
// ✅ Allow for all CRUD operations via one or more APIs



//Task 1: Make a form

//build a form that allows the user to either 
// create or update items with specific data.
//The form can be in a modal or collapsible sidebar, 
// or it can just be always visible in the app.
//Warning: Making an update form that’s always visible can get a little tricky, 
// because you have to update the in-progress form state to match the data of the item you’re editing when you pick an item to edit. 
// If you’d like to try it, you may need to do some research into how to handle it correctly. 
// Making an update form in a modal usually works much nicer, because the insides of the modal get torn down and recreated every time the modal is opened.

//Task 2: Test
//Make sure your app is working correctly by 
// testing out the form in various ways. 
// Make sure you can use the form multiple times to create or update different items.
//At this point, your project must meet this new requirement:
//- It has either a create form or an update form with at least 2 inputs
//As well as the requirements from previous weeks:
// ✅ It has at least 3 React components
//- It’s displaying the data
// ✅ It’s using at least 1 prop
//-✅ A user can create new items
//-✅ A user can delete items
//-✅ A user can update at least one property on the items
